Task 3: Binary Thresholding Question
A pixel in a grayscale image has a value of 180. If the threshold for binary thresholding is set to
150, what is the new pixel value after applying binary thresholding? (Assume output values are 0
for pixels below the threshold and 255 for pixels above the threshold.)

Answer:
Given original pixel value to be 180 and threshold value to be 150;
The binary threshold rule:

- Pixels below threshold turn to 0
- Pexels above threshold turn to 255

Since 180 > 150(the pixel value is above the threshold), the new pixel value after binary thresholding wil be 255
